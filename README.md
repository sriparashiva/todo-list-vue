## 📍 Overview

The project is a TodoList application developed using Vue.js framework, allowing users to add, edit, and remove tasks. It provides features such as filtering tasks based on completion status, completing all tasks at once, and clearing completed tasks. The core purpose is to help users manage their tasks efficiently and stay organized. The value proposition lies in its simplicity, intuitive user interface, and the ability to customize and organize tasks effectively.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The system follows a single-page application (SPA) architecture using Vue.js. It utilizes components-based design to structure the TodoList application.   |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The repository lacks explicit documentation. Some code comments are present, but additional documentation would improve clarity and ease of maintenance.     |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The system relies on Vue.js framework and various plugins/components provided by Vue ecosystem. Vite is used as a build tool for the Vue application. |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The system is organized into modular components, such as the App.vue file, enabling easier reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.     |
| **✔️ Testing**          | The codebase does not include any tests, and there are no specific testing strategies or tools in place. The addition of appropriate testing would be beneficial.  |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | Since it is a client-side application, the performance is affected by the user's system and browser performance. However, no specific performance optimizations are implemented. |
| **🔐 Security**        | The todo-list application does not interact with any external systems or APIs. Data security measures are limited since this is a front-end only application. |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The project uses Git as the version control system. The codebase is hosted on GitHub and follows a typical development workflow using branching and pull requests. |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | There are no significant integrations with other systems or services. The application is self-contained and operates solely on the client-side.            |
| **📶 Scalability**     | The system's ability to handle growth depends on the client's system capabilities as it is built as a client-side application. No specific scalability measures are seen. |

Note: The codebase lacks clarity on specific application features and patterns due to limited details in the provided information.

| [index.html](https://github.com/sriparashiva/todo-list-vue/blob/main/index.html)         | This code sets up the basic structure of an HTML document for a Vite app. It includes a viewport meta tag, a title for the app, and a script tag linking to the main JavaScript file. The main JavaScript file is responsible for rendering the app and is located in the /src directory.                                                                                                            |
| [vite.config.js](https://github.com/sriparashiva/todo-list-vue/blob/main/vite.config.js) | This code is a Vite configuration file that uses the Vite plugin for Vue.js. It sets up an alias for the src directory and includes the Vue plugin. The resolve.alias allows paths to be written using the "@" symbol instead of file system paths, providing a simpler way to reference files in the project. This configuration enhances the development experience and improves code readability. |

| [App.vue](https://github.com/sriparashiva/todo-list-vue/blob/main/src/App.vue) | This code provides the functionality of a todo list app. Users can add, remove, and edit tasks. Tasks can be marked as completed, and users can also filter tasks by completion status. The code is implemented using the Vue.js framework. |
| [main.js](https://github.com/sriparashiva/todo-list-vue/blob/main/src/main.js) | This code creates a Vue application, rendering the content of the App.vue file and mounts it to the element with the ID "app" in the HTML document.                                                                                         |
